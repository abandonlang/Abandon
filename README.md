# Abandon
It is a program for a programming language named `Abandon`.
> I believe all Chinese English learners can spell it. So I named it `Abandon`, but that doesnâ€™t mean I intend to abandon the project.  

This project is WIP.

If you have `makefile` in your computer, you can run:
``` bash
make
```
or, you can run:
``` bash
