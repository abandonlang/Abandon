# Abandon
It is a program for a programming language named `Abandon`.
> I believe all Chinese English learners can spell it. So I named it `Abandon`, but that doesnâ€™t mean I intend to abandon the project.

## Compile this project
If you have `makefile` in your computer, you can run:
``` bash
make
```
or, you can run:
``` bash
g++ src/main.cc src/AST/AST.cc src/CmdLineParser/CmdLineParser.cc src/debug/debug.cc src/FileManager/FileManager.cc src/Lexer/signToken.cc src/Lexer/Lexer.cc src/Parser/Parser.cc src/SayError/SayError.cc src/Token/Token.cc -o abandon -std=c++11 -DDEBUG
```
`-DDEBUG` means compile in debug mode (just in this project).  
Since the project is under development, it is recommended to keep the `-DDEBUG` flag for ease of debugging.
