# Abandon
It is a program for a programming language named `Abandon`.
> I just think *all* the Chinese (especially students) can spell it. So I named it Abandon. But I do not want to abandon it.

## Compile this project
You can run it in system console:
``` bash
g++ main.cc FileManager/FileManager.cc Token/Token.cc Lexer/Lexer.cc Lexer/signToken.cc SayError/SayError.cc -o main -std=c++11 -DDEBUG
```
`-DDEBUG` means compile in debug mode (just in this project).  
Now it is in progress, so you cannot delete it.
